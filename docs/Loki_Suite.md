## Database Schema & Transaction Control

### 📊 Core Database Tables

The Loki Suite uses 6 primary tables to manage webhook subscriptions, events, and execution chains:

#### 1. webhook_subscriptions
**Purpose**: Store webhook endpoint configurations and security credentials

```sql
CREATE TABLE webhook_subscriptions (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    tenant_id VARCHAR NOT NULL,                    -- Multi-tenancy isolation
    app_name VARCHAR NOT NULL,                     -- Application identifier
    target_url VARCHAR NOT NULL,                   -- Webhook delivery endpoint
    subscribed_event VARCHAR NOT NULL,             -- Event filter
    type VARCHAR NOT NULL CHECK (type IN ('public', 'private')),  -- Security model
    secret_token VARCHAR NOT NULL,                 -- HMAC signature key
    auth_token VARCHAR,                           -- JWT token for private webhooks
    retry_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0,                -- Failed delivery attempts
    is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,               -- Subscription status
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Indexes for performance
CREATE INDEX idx_webhook_subscriptions_tenant_event 
ON webhook_subscriptions(tenant_id, subscribed_event);

CREATE INDEX idx_webhook_subscriptions_active 
ON webhook_subscriptions(is_active, tenant_id);
```

**Transaction Control**:
- **INSERT**: Atomic webhook creation with auto-generated security tokens
- **UPDATE**: Version-controlled updates with optimistic locking
- **DELETE**: Soft delete to maintain audit trail

#### 2. webhook_events
**Purpose**: Track webhook events and delivery status

```sql
CREATE TABLE webhook_events (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    tenant_id VARCHAR NOT NULL,                    -- Tenant isolation
    event_name VARCHAR NOT NULL,                   -- Event type identifier
    source VARCHAR NOT NULL,                       -- Event source system
    payload JSONB NOT NULL,                       -- Event data (indexed)
    status VARCHAR DEFAULT 'pending' CHECK (status IN ('pending', 'sent', 'failed')),
    response_code INTEGER,                        -- HTTP response from delivery
    attempts INTEGER DEFAULT 0,                  -- Delivery attempt counter
    last_error TEXT,                             -- Error message from last attempt
    sent_at TIMESTAMP,                           -- Successful delivery timestamp
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Indexes for event processing
CREATE INDEX idx_webhook_events_tenant_status 
ON webhook_events(tenant_id, status);

CREATE INDEX idx_webhook_events_created_at 
ON webhook_events(created_at);

-- JSONB index for payload queries
CREATE INDEX idx_webhook_events_payload 
ON webhook_events USING GIN (payload);
```

**Transaction Control**:
- **Event Creation**: Uses database transactions to ensure event atomicity
- **Status Updates**: Optimistic locking prevents race conditions during delivery
- **Retry Logic**: Atomic increment of attempt counter with exponential backoff

#### 3. execution_chains
**Purpose**: Define sequential webhook execution workflows

```sql
CREATE TABLE execution_chains (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    tenant_id VARCHAR NOT NULL,                    -- Tenant isolation
    name VARCHAR NOT NULL,                         -- Human-readable chain name
    description TEXT,                             -- Chain purpose documentation
    status VARCHAR DEFAULT 'pending' CHECK (status IN ('pending', 'running', 'completed', 'failed', 'paused')),
    trigger_event VARCHAR NOT NULL,               -- Event that triggers chain
    is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,               -- Chain execution status
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Indexes for chain execution
CREATE INDEX idx_execution_chains_tenant_trigger 
ON execution_chains(tenant_id, trigger_event, is_active);
```

#### 4. execution_chain_steps
**Purpose**: Define individual steps within execution chains

```sql
CREATE TABLE execution_chain_steps (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    chain_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES execution_chains(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    step_order INTEGER NOT NULL,                  -- Execution sequence
    webhook_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES webhook_subscriptions(id),
    name VARCHAR NOT NULL,                        -- Step identifier
    description TEXT,                            -- Step purpose
    request_params JSONB,                        -- Template parameters
    on_success_action VARCHAR DEFAULT 'continue' CHECK (on_success_action IN ('continue', 'stop', 'pause')),
    on_failure_action VARCHAR DEFAULT 'stop' CHECK (on_failure_action IN ('continue', 'stop', 'retry')),
    retry_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0,               -- Current retry attempts
    max_retries INTEGER DEFAULT 3,               -- Maximum retry limit
    delay_seconds INTEGER DEFAULT 0,             -- Delay before execution
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Unique constraint for step ordering
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_execution_chain_steps_order 
ON execution_chain_steps(chain_id, step_order);
```

#### 5. execution_chain_runs
**Purpose**: Track individual executions of chains

```sql
CREATE TABLE execution_chain_runs (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    chain_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES execution_chains(id),
    tenant_id VARCHAR NOT NULL,                    -- Denormalized for performance
    status VARCHAR DEFAULT 'pending' CHECK (status IN ('pending', 'running', 'completed', 'failed', 'paused')),
    trigger_event VARCHAR NOT NULL,               -- Event that triggered run
    trigger_data JSONB NOT NULL,                  -- Original event payload
    current_step INTEGER DEFAULT 0,              -- Current execution step
    total_steps INTEGER NOT NULL,                -- Total steps in chain
    started_at TIMESTAMP,                        -- Execution start time
    completed_at TIMESTAMP,                      -- Execution completion time
    last_error TEXT,                            -- Error from failed step
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Indexes for run tracking
CREATE INDEX idx_execution_chain_runs_chain_status 
ON execution_chain_runs(chain_id, status);

CREATE INDEX idx_execution_chain_runs_tenant_created 
ON execution_chain_runs(tenant_id, created_at);
```

#### 6. execution_chain_step_runs
**Purpose**: Track individual step executions within chain runs

```sql
CREATE TABLE execution_chain_step_runs (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    run_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES execution_chain_runs(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    step_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES execution_chain_steps(id),
    step_order INTEGER NOT NULL,                  -- Step sequence position
    status VARCHAR DEFAULT 'pending' CHECK (status IN ('pending', 'running', 'sent', 'failed')),
    request_payload JSONB,                        -- Request sent to webhook
    response_code INTEGER,                        -- HTTP response code
    response_body TEXT,                          -- Response from webhook
    attempt_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0,             -- Retry attempts
    last_error TEXT,                            -- Error message

    completed_at TIMESTAMP,                      -- Step completion time
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Indexes for step run analysis
CREATE INDEX idx_execution_chain_step_runs_run 
ON execution_chain_step_runs(run_id, step_order);
```

### 🔒 Transaction Control Mechanisms

#### 1. ACID Compliance
- **Atomicity**: All database operations use transactions to ensure complete success or rollback
- **Consistency**: Foreign key constraints maintain referential integrity
- **Isolation**: Read committed isolation level prevents dirty reads
- **Durability**: WAL (Write-Ahead Logging) ensures transaction persistence

#### 2. Concurrency Control
```go
// Example: Atomic webhook event processing
func (r *webhookRepository) ProcessEventWithRetry(eventID uuid.UUID) error {
    tx := r.db.Begin()
    defer func() {
        if r := recover(); r != nil {
            tx.Rollback()
        }
    }()

    // Lock event record for update
    var event models.WebhookEvent
    if err := tx.Set("gorm:query_option", "FOR UPDATE").
        First(&event, "id = ?", eventID).Error; err != nil {
        tx.Rollback()
        return err
    }

    // Update attempt count atomically
    event.Attempts++
    if err := tx.Save(&event).Error; err != nil {
        tx.Rollback()
        return err
    }

    return tx.Commit().Error
}
```

#### 3. Multi-Tenant Data Isolation
- **Row-Level Security**: Every table includes `tenant_id` for isolation
- **Query Filtering**: All queries automatically filter by tenant
- **Index Optimization**: Composite indexes start with `tenant_id`

#### 4. Execution Chain Transaction Management
```go
// Example: Chain execution with step rollback
func (s *executionChainService) ExecuteChainWithRollback(
    chainRun *models.ExecutionChainRun,
) error {
    tx := s.db.Begin()
    
    for i, step := range chainRun.Chain.Steps {
        stepRun := &models.ExecutionChainStepRun{
            RunID:     chainRun.ID,
            StepID:    step.ID,
            StepOrder: step.StepOrder,
        }
        
        // Execute step within transaction
        if err := s.executeStep(tx, stepRun); err != nil {
            // Rollback entire chain on critical failure
            if step.OnFailureAction == "stop" {
                tx.Rollback()
                return err
            }
        }
        
        // Update chain progress
        chainRun.CurrentStep = i + 1
        tx.Save(chainRun)
    }
    
    return tx.Commit().Error
}
```

## Security Models

### 🔐 Dual Security Architecture

Loki Suite implements a sophisticated dual security model that provides different levels of protection based on webhook type:

#### 1. Public Webhook Security (HMAC Only)
**Use Case**: External integrations, public APIs, third-party services

```
Request Headers:
├── Content-Type: application/json
├── X-Loki-Signature: sha256=<hmac_signature>
├── X-Loki-Timestamp: <unix_timestamp>
└── X-Loki-Event: <event_name>
```

**Security Implementation**:
```go
func (s *securityService) VerifyPublicWebhook(
    payload []byte, 
    signature string, 
    timestamp string, 
    secretToken string,
) error {
    // 1. Timestamp validation (replay attack prevention)
    reqTime, err := time.Parse(time.RFC3339, timestamp)
    if time.Since(reqTime) > 5*time.Minute {
        return errors.New("request timestamp too old")
    }
    
    // 2. HMAC signature verification
    expectedSignature := s.GenerateHMACSignature(payload, secretToken)
    if !hmac.Equal([]byte(signature), []byte(expectedSignature)) {
        return errors.New("invalid HMAC signature")
    }
    
    return nil
}
```

#### 2. Private Webhook Security (HMAC + JWT)
**Use Case**: Internal microservices, sensitive data, financial transactions

```
Request Headers:
├── Content-Type: application/json
├── Authorization: Bearer <jwt_token>
├── X-Loki-Signature: sha256=<hmac_signature>
├── X-Loki-Timestamp: <unix_timestamp>
└── X-Loki-Event: <event_name>
```

**JWT Token Structure**:
```json
{
  "header": {
    "alg": "HS256",
    "typ": "JWT"
  },
  "payload": {
    "sub": "webhook_id",           // Subject (webhook ID)
    "tenant_id": "tenant_123",     // Tenant identifier
    "webhook_id": "webhook_uuid",  // Webhook subscription ID
    "app_name": "payment_service", // Application name
    "iss": "loki-suite",          // Issuer
    "iat": 1641024000,            // Issued at
    "exp": 1641110400,            // Expiration
    "nbf": 1641024000             // Not before
  }
}
```

**Complete Verification Process**:
```go
func (s *securityService) VerifyPrivateWebhook(
    webhookID uuid.UUID,
    payload []byte,
    signature string,
    timestamp string,
    authHeader string,
) error {
    // 1. Extract JWT token from Authorization header
    token := strings.TrimPrefix(authHeader, "Bearer ")
    
    // 2. Validate JWT token structure and signature
    claims, err := s.ValidateJWTToken(token)
    if err != nil {
        return fmt.Errorf("JWT validation failed: %w", err)
    }
    
    // 3. Verify webhook ID matches token claims
    if claims.WebhookID != webhookID.String() {
        return errors.New("webhook ID mismatch")
    }
    
    // 4. Verify tenant isolation
    webhook, err := s.repo.GetWebhookByID(webhookID)
    if webhook.TenantID != claims.TenantID {
        return errors.New("tenant mismatch")
    }
    
    // 5. Perform HMAC verification
    return s.VerifyPublicWebhook(payload, signature, timestamp, webhook.SecretToken)
}
```

### 🛡️ Security Benefits

#### Multi-Layer Protection
1. **JWT Authentication**: Verifies caller identity and authorization
2. **HMAC Signatures**: Ensures payload integrity and authenticity
3. **Timestamp Validation**: Prevents replay attacks
4. **Tenant Isolation**: Ensures data segregation
